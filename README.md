# Snapshot Tool

_srry sloppy code but ask GPT to clean it I got other stuffs to do_

Take snapshot of holders, minters, or p much any other event log from erc721. works w evm chains.

also some python scripts for playing with data formats

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

`yarn` or `npm i`

i dont usually write js/ts tbh idk y i have all these lint eslint package tsconfig etc. i scrapped this together from a diff project. but it's there and it works so i didn't touch it

### Run

Take a snapshot with `ts-node src/snap-holders.ts`

To do python stuff, make sure you are in the `py/` directory and run `python3 script.py`
