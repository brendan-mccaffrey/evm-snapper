# Snapshot Tool

_srry sloppy code but ask GPT to clean it I got other stuffs to do_

This project can be used to take a snapshot of NFT holders and/or minters of an NFT collection. It is compatible with a variety of blockchains and can be used to take snapshots of NFT holders on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism, and more.

This also contains some python scripts to help convert the results into a variety of preferred file formats.

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies

`yarn` or `npm i`

i dont usually write js/ts tbh idk y i have all these lint eslint package tsconfig etc. i scrapped this together from a diff project. but it's there and it works so i didn't touch it

### Run

Take a snapshot with `ts-node src/snap-holders.ts`

To do python stuff, make sure you are in the `py/` directory and run `python3 script.py`
